I drizzled the whole thing with some Kahlua chocolate sauce that I found at TJ Maxx, of all places, then topped the ice cream with a maraschino cherry.

While it was sitting and waiting for \"dinner time\" I added a couple scoops of sour cream and some cream cheese, about 4 oz. to try to cut the saltiness down. It worked GREAT.

D1 dough tasted flat, too starchy (potato-ey), and dense, while D2 proved to be fluffly, easier to worok with, and simply--just right.  Oh, and I also replaced the brown sugar with honey powder (found in Korean markets), and before closing up my dough ball, I would squeeze a dollop of honey over the honey powder so to help speed up the melting process for the syrup formation.  Adding even just a bit of syrup over your brown sugar will help!  :)  Awesome, awesome recipe!

When flattening the dough, I oil my hand liberally so the dough doesn't stick unto my hand, and then flatten on top of a greased board, spread it about .5cm thick, and then put two large tablespoons of filling, add a bit of honey, and then fold over all corners into a round ball.  On the skillet, I lay the round ball atop a layer of hot oil, and after about 15-30 sec., I flip it over and THEN flatten as much as possible.

I worked in the gift shop and didn\\'t ever think to get \"the recipe\" (most things came partially pre-prepared, anyway) I did eat it just about every day. :D  Anyway, this is very, very close to the real thing. How I do this:  I would suggest cutting back on the sour cream a little bit.  Also, they use COLBY cheese, not cheddar.  Add a little more onion and use a sweet white onion.  Use cream of celery soup (although I cannot attest to the chicken soup, as we make it vegetarian so our whole family can eat it.)  And mix that soup/butter/sour cream mixture into the potatoes instead of putting it on top.  Mix the cheese in, too.  If you eat at Cracker Barrel you will notice that the cheese is dispersed throughout the potatoes, not just on top.  Make sure to use plenty of salt and pepper. I brown mine in the broiler for a few minutes at the end of cooking to get it to have the same crispier texture that contrasts nicely with the rest of the softer, creamier potatoes.  The length of time that you cook this can make a big difference to the flavor.  It can even vary from restaurant to restaurant and even just depending on when you are eating there relative to when it was first prepared.  Longer times yield a softer potato with a nice crispy top...shorter times and the potatoes are firmer and the flavors just haven\\'t melded as nicely.

I sauteed in a little butter: 1/2 med-large sweet onion (about 1/2 cup, chopped), 1/2 cup bell pepper, chopped (I used some red and some green). All were sprinkled  on after the eggs set, in this order; sauteed onions and peppers, ham, bacon, cheese. I also, as others suggested, sprinkled more grated cheese over the finished roll, placed it back in the oven till it melted.

First I found the ingredients list out of order and difficult to follow.  The directions do not specify what size pudding mix to use, so I used 5 oz boxes.  My cookies were fine so I assume that was correct.  In addition, no where in the directions does it say where to add the pudding.  I ended up sifting it with the flour and baking soda.  I was concerned about the lack of salt, but there appears to be enough salt in the pudding to make up for it.  Finally, the amount of chocolate chips was a bit confusing the recipe calls for 3 (108) packages of chocolate chips.  I used 3 - 12 oz packages of semi sweet chocolate chips.  This came to 36 ounces total.  I felt the chocolate chip ratio was perfect.  108 oz of chocolate chips would be 9 - 12 oz packages I don\\'t think that would work.\\r\\nOverall I would give a 5 star for the taste and living up to the name, but a 2 star for the directions.  Since I could fix the directions and the taste is great I finalized with 4 stars.')\n","(1030637, 383346, 195793, '2007-07-17', 5, 'I made 12 muffins and one little bread.

I used it to frost a 9 X 13 inch Duncan Hines Devil's Food cake (I will also have to try making my own cakes from scratch as well).  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I left the salt out.  I wanted to taste the frosting first without the salt and both myself and my husband liked it so much, we didn't want to add the salt the first time out.  I will try it with the salt next time.  So far, the frosting is delicious (from our scooping some out of the mixing bowl to sample it :)  We will  be trying it on the cake shortly and I will update.  Really great flavor though on it's own and the consistency gets smoother the longer you whip the frosting (I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make the frosting).

Also, put your coarsely chopped apricots on some paper towels and then press most of the juice out of them.  Otherwise, the excess juice will cause a 'ricotta cheese' texture in the finished product...unless you like that.  I prefer 'creamy' and found that pressing most of the juice out did not alter the flavor the second time and made the cake 'creamy'.  Lastly, I have a new gas oven, but still found that I had to bake it for a total of 86 minutes the first time, and 83 minutes the second time.  I like the cheesecake to rise and crack a little around the edges, with a few brown spots on the top.  That way I know it has been cooked adequately.

Most cheesecake recipes call for 4-5 blocks of cream cheese. So 1.5 lbs, which is only 3 blocks didn't seem right to me. With 5 eggs, if you don't add that extra block of cheese your cheesecake will come out too custardy- which is what I saw several other reviewers unhappy with. 5 eggs is the usual amount I'm used to using. I also omitted the flour and instead used cornstarch- 3 tbs to be exact. I only used the roughly chopped Oreos in the center of the cake too because I prefer to top my cheesecakes with fresh whipped cream- chopped Oreos go on top for the crunch factor.

The quiche came out so light and fluffy and was totally delicious. I think I might even try adding some ham in next time. I loved the combination of all the cheeses with the leeks and onoin..

I also increased the onion to 1/2 an onion for the broth. The resulting broth was rich, and decadent. Perfect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That was my only deviation from the recipe.

Added about an extra tbsp butter to the batter, as the yoogurt was non-fat. Also, as if that is not change enough, I added about 2 c. frozen dark cherries, cutting up individually by hand first, and flouring them, before completely defrosted so they wouldn&#039;t be mush.

I don't really have a point of reference for this type of noodle, though, so it could just be the way that type of noodle cooks up. I also added a little bit of Thai basil with the other herbs, just because I like it. I served it with the recommended Nuoc Cham #103760, too (which I think I could have eaten all by itself). I definitely think this is something that needs to be eaten as soon as possible after cooking, because I didn't like the texture of the dish as much after a few hours (I made it in the morning and brought some to work for dinner). I'll have to make it again sometime when I can actually sit and eat it right away, because I love it freshly made.

First I added the recommended 1 Tablespoon, and couldn't taste the peppermint at all and needed to add another two tablesppons to make this taste pepperminty enough.

I dried them overnight under a clean tea towel after drying them for 2 hours  and turning them over, and the next morning they dipped like a dream... considering I'm a messy dipper LOL. If you are using ESSENCE instead of Extract I would *strongly recommend* not using the entire amount of the 14oz condensed milk to compensate for the extra liquid that the essence will make, or halve the recipe becuase I got at least 90 of my small ones from only *half* the mixture I ended up having.
